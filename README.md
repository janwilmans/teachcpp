# teachcpp
Teach c++, a library that offers constructs that are useful for **teaching** C++ 

The goal this library is to offer constructs that help to avoid teaching out-of-order in the sense that we want to:
- teach simple things first
- avoid having the teaching order dicatated by artifacts of the language that exist only for lecagy and backwards compatibility reasons.
